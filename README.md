# FabricCalculator
A Windows mini application built using the PyQt4 library that performs specialized calculations. Why couldn't this be done simply with a little bit of code to do the calculations? Because the people who need the application (tailors) don't know how to install Python or run a script. So, using a language I know quite well (and also for a little bit of a challenge seeing as I've never really seen a desktop app being built in Python), I'm trying to create a simple interface that's easy to use and allows tailors to calculate and, hopefully later, create specific invoices and documents related to the measurements making the hard work nice and easy for them. Hence the Fabric Calculator.
